### :hammer_and_wrench: How to compile the desktop client

:building_construction: [System requirements](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/wiki/System-requirements-for-compiling-the-desktop-client) includes OpenSSL 1.1.x, QtKeychain, Qt 5.x.x and zlib.

#### :memo: Step by step instructions

##### Clone the repo and create build directory
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fsscloud/desktop.git
$ cd desktop
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
##### Compile and install

:warning: For development reasons it is better to **install the client on user space** instead on the global system. Mixing up libs/dll's of different version can lead to undefined behavior and crashes:

* You could use the **cmake flag** ```CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``` as ```~/.local/``` in a **Linux** system. If you want to install system wide you could use ```/usr/local``` or ```/opt/nextcloud/```.

* On **Windows 10** [```$USERPROFILE```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/usmt/usmt-recognized-environment-variables#a-href-idbkmk-2avariables-that-are-recognized-only-in-the-user-context) refers to ```C:\Users\<USERNAME>```.

##### Linux & Mac OS

```
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/nextcloud-desktop-client -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DNO_SHIBBOLETH=1
$ make install
```

##### Windows

```
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$USERPROFILE\fss-desktop-client -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DNO_SHIBBOLETH=1
$ cmake --build . --config Debug --target install
```
